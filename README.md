# NeuroNLP++ Frontend

NeuroNLP++ is a modern web-based portal for navigating fruit fly brain circuit data powered by a free-form question-answer engine integrating neuron types in the Drosophila brain together with relevant literature. [DrosoBOT](https://github.com/mkturkcan/DrosoBOT), an NLP engine, is used to interpret user queries, to find relevant concepts and entries about cell types, and to map those concepts to neurons in a connectomics dataset.
